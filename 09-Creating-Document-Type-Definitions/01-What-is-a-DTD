What is a DTD?:
----------------
- There are a couple of different ways to associate sets of rules with your XML documents,
  to help ensure their quality and make sure that they are, as error free as possible.
- One of those ways is through what's called document type definitions(DTD).
--------------------
- Provide way to constrain XML document content
- Specify what kind of content can appear
- Where can be included in XML file, or be external to document
- Relatively simple to write, but not powerful
-------------
Why would you use a DTD?
1 - If we are taking XML code and giving it to third parties, then it's a good idea to
  make sure that the XML code is in a proper format. And DTD help make that possible.
  - So we can give DTD out to people that are consuming your XML and when the parser goes
  to load the XML, it will compare the DTD rule set with the content, so that the errors can
  be found quickly.
2 - Certain kinds of XML tools like XML Editors can also use DTDs to help you create
  XML content on the fly, so that errors won't be introduced while the creation process.
