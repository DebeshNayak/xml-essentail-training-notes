XML-related technologies:
1. XPath - eXtensible Path Language
  - The reason it's called XPath is because if you've ever worked with folder and
    directory names and filenames, you'll notice that most computer systems organize
    those as a path.
  - So there's a route drive, and that's followed by some folder names down to a
    filename.
  - And all of those are usually separated by some kind of path character, like a
    slash or a colon.
  - XPath is very similar, and it's used to find and extract information from XML documents

2. XSLT - XML Stylesheet language Transformations
  - XSLT can be used to style XML information, but the real important word there is
    transformations.
  - XSLT is a way of taking XML information and transforming it into another XML format,
    PDF, text file, web page or may be other kind of file format.

3. XQuery - More advanced querying language than XPath
  - XQuery, is a querying language, like a database language, like SQL except for XML.
  - It's used for extracting information in a very advanced way from XML data.
  - Using XQuery, you can build really complex queries that search multiple XML
    files to extract information.

4. XPointer/XLink - Links between and within XML documents
  - Create links between and within XML documents
  - Conceptually, this is similar to the link tag in HTML with a lot more power.

- The XQuery, XPointer, and XLink are very advance. And we are not covering in this course
- We are focusing on XPath and XSLT.
