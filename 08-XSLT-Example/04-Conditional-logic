Conditional Logic:
- One of the powerful capabilities of XSLT, is the ability to apply style sheet
  templates, based upon the values of the incoming XML data.

  - Conditional tag
  <xsl:if test="condition">

  - Switch statement like tag
  <xsl:choose>, <xsl:when>, <xsl:otherwise>

- Using XSLT it is pretty easy, straight forward to incorporate conditional logic
  into these style sheets.
