Proper XML syntax:
* XML documents must have a single root tag
* XML documents must be "well-formed"
* Empty tags must be closed with />
  - Instead of <elem></elem>, use <elem />
* Attribute values cannot be minimized
* Attribute values must be inside of quotes, single or double
  - <elem attr=val> is illegal, use <elem attr="val">
* Tag properly nested inside each other.
