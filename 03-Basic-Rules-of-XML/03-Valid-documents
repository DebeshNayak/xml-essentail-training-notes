Valid XML documents:
- Well formed XML document - if the XML document correctly parse by the XML parser
- Valid XML document - if we provide a set of rules to XML parser and it parse it correctly
There is two ways to do this:
1. Document Type Definitions (DTDs)
  - Simple to use, but not very powerful
  - Written using a syntax that's different than XML

2. XML Schema
  - Much more powerful and flexible than DTD
  - Written using XML syntax rules
